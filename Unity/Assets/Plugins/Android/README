For AdMob SDK 4.3.1, the Android project must be compiled
against at least Android SDK r-13 (Android 3.2).

To run on lower Android devices (Android 2.x etc.),
you can set android:minSdkVersion in AndroidManifest.xml
to lower level, like 8 (Android 2.2).

From Eclipse, add classes.jar from Unity to the project build path.
On Mac it is usually placed at:
/Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/bin/classes.jar
or on Windows at:
C:/Program Files/Unity/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/androidplayer/bin/classes.jar

You can also edit .classpath directly.
